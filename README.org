* Adding operator[] to =std::tuple=.

** Rationale

Currently in order to access tuples, we need to use the
=std::get<>= family of functions.

The user expectation is usually that a tuple should be indexable
with operator[]. This is the convention followed by the rest of the
library components and gives more interface uniformity.
=std::get<>= is also more verbose.


** Proposal

I propose to add =operator[]= to =std::tuple= in the following way:


#+BEGIN_src C++
  template <class...Types>
  template<std::size_t I>
  constexpr std::tuple_element_t<I, tuple<Types...> >&
      std::tuple<Types...>::operator[](std::integral_constant<std::size_t, I>) &;
#+END_src


This way we could do the following:

#+BEGIN_src C++
template <std::size_t I>
constexpr std::integral_constant<std::size_t, I> c;

auto fib = make_tuple(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21);

//Before:
f(std::get<0>(fib), std::get<1>(fib), std::get<2>(fib), std::get<3>(fib),
  std::get<4>(fib));

//Now:
f(fib[c<0>], fib[c<1>], fib[c<2>], fib[c<3>], fib[c<4>]);


//Or with a standard user-defined literal:
f(fib[0is], fib[1is], fib[2is], fib[3is], fib[4is]);
#+END_src Other open questions

** Open questions

- Should we have standard variable templates or user-defined literals
  for =std::integral_constant=s?
